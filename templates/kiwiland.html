	<p>New Zealand.<br>
	We have always been quite a progressive and well-off country. <br>
	However we are approaching an interesting and very important time. <br>
	Were we will get to decide as a nation whether we want to keep allowing our nation to remain unbalanced, and to tilt out of balance further. <br>
	Or whether we will use the technology and power we are given to create a more equal and just country for all of it's inhabitants.
	<br><br>
	Next year is our year of election.<br>
	I believe we as a citizens will be given an important choice.<br>
	Were we can choose to keep our governing body standard. Which will most likely result in Mr Key remaining as prime minister for his fourth term.<br>
	Or I believe we can exhibit our progessive thinking in the way we elect our next government, and what that government's goals shall be.<br>
	We as a country that shares no borders and has a potential to allow all residents to have a high standard of living should be discussing some important points for our next term so that we as the citizens get the most out of our government.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Taxs and living wages</li>
		<li>Sustainablity with our imports & exports</li>
		<li>Rules & regulations of land use for commercial industry</li>
		<li>More freedom & less routine</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		These are a few areas that come to my mind in which we could improve in greatly which i believe would make a healthier and happier nation.<br>
